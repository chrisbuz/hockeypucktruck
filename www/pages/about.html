            <h4>Why Hockey Puck?</h4> <br>
            <p>
                Diners have been considered to be the most widespread and culturally diverse establishments in the United States. They started as horse-pulled food wagons and later transformed into prefabricated buildings in their heydays of the 1950s. With their casual setting and value-driven menus they became the living room of the community.

                Inspired by the every-day lingo between the waiter and the cook at the diner, Hockey Puck was the code-word used to describe a well-done hamburger. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Influenced by the humble beginnings of the diner from its horse-pulled days we strive to preserve the essence of the diner as well as innovate contemporary flare.
